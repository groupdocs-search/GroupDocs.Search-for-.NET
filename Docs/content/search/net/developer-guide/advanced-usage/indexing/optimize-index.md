An index optimization operation allows you to reduce the number of segments in an index, thereby increasing search performance in the index.

To perform this operation, there is an overload that takes the [MergeOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/search/groupdocs.search.options/mergeoptions) instance as a parameter. In the [MergeOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/search/groupdocs.search.options/mergeoptions) class, there is a property for specifying a cancellation object and a property for specifying whether to perform the operation asynchronously. By default, the operation is performed synchronously.

The following example demonstrates how to perform the index optimization.

**C#**

```csharp
string indexFolder = @"c:\MyIndex\";
string documentsFolder1 = @"c:\MyDocuments1\";
string documentsFolder2 = @"c:\MyDocuments2\";
string documentsFolder3 = @"c:\MyDocuments3\";
 
// Creating an index in the specified folder
Index index = new Index(indexFolder);
 
index.Add(documentsFolder1); // Indexing documents from the specified folder
index.Add(documentsFolder2); // Each call to Add creates at least one new segment in the index
index.Add(documentsFolder3);
 
MergeOptions options = new MergeOptions();
options.Cancellation = new Cancellation(); // Creating cancellation object to be able to cancel the operation
options.Cancellation.CancelAfter(100000); // Setting maximum duration of the operation to 100 seconds
 
// Merging segments of the index
index.Optimize(options);
```
