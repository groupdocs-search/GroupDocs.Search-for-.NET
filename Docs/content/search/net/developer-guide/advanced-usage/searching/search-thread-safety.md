## Multiple simultaneous searches

Search in an index is a thread safe operation. This means that calls to the [Search](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/search/groupdocs.search/index/methods/search/index) and [SearchNext](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/search/groupdocs.search/index/methods/searchnext/index) methods can be made from different threads to the same instance of the [Index](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/search/groupdocs.search/index) class without any cross-threading problems.

## Search during indexing, updating, optimizing, or merging operation

Simultaneous search from different threads is a thread safe operation and can be performed even during indexing, updating, optimizing, and merging operations.

However, indexing, updating, optimizing, and merging operations themselves cannot be performed at the same time. A new start of one of these operations before the completion of the previous operation will result in an error.

Details on performing these operations can be found in the [Search thread safety]({{< ref "search/net/developer-guide/advanced-usage/searching/search-thread-safety.md" >}}) section and on the [Search thread safety]({{< ref "search/net/developer-guide/advanced-usage/searching/search-thread-safety.md" >}}), [Search thread safety]({{< ref "search/net/developer-guide/advanced-usage/searching/search-thread-safety.md" >}}), and [Search thread safety]({{< ref "search/net/developer-guide/advanced-usage/searching/search-thread-safety.md" >}}) pages.
